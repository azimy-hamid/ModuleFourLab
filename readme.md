# Purple Horizon Financial - Mini Project One

## Description

Unlike the lab for module 3 where I had given comments in each file; here I have given almost all the instructions in this readme file

Below I have added a table of content to explain each of the labs separately :)

## Table of Contents

- [Lab One](#LabOne)
- [Lab Two](#LabTwo)
- [Lab Three](#LabThree)
- [Lab Four](#LabFour)
- [Lab Five](#LabFive)
- [Lab Six](#LabSix)
- [Lab Seven](#LabSeven)
- [Lab Eight](#LabEight)
- [Lab Nine](#LabNine)
- [Lab Ten](#LabTen)

## Lab One

For lab one, I have created an .md file with the link to my figma design in it.

## Lab Two

For lab two, I have commented all the javascript code in the main.js file and that's why you'll find the index.html file empty when you open it.
To make it more readable, you can uncomment each section separately to see the result. I have used multiline comment to separate each section of the lab.

To see the result: open the index.html and then uncomment eaech section of the main.js to see the specific results

## Lab Three

In lab three, I have added all the functionalities asked in the lab; however, the only part I got confused with was that I have directly stated creating the functionlaities of the website and haven't really followed all the steps in the exercise in order. For ex. in the lab we're asked to create a separate git branch for each functionality of the lab (Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division). I have't created a separate git branch for each functionlity; however I have created a git branch for each lab in this module which sort of creates the same practice.

Other than this, I have implemented all the functionalities

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Four

In the lab, we're asked to create the cards statically in html; however, I wanted to practice adding the cards dynamically from the js file, so I created an array of the cards data and used that to display the cards in the html. Other than this, all of the cards are responsive as the lab had asked for.

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Five

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Six

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Seven

For this lab, I have used Chat GPT since I wasn't very good with css animations; in fact, I was completely new to it, so I used Chat Gpt to help me with it. However, I do understand all the code :)

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Eight

Also, for this lab I used chat gpt to understand how moment.js works and I do understand all the code.
While going through the documentation of moment.js, I found out that the developers of moment.js are no longer going to create new features and actually prefer developer to use other alternatives to moment.js, but I used moment.js since it's what the lab had asked for.

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Nine

To run: Run the index.html and you'll be able to see the result, you don't have to uncomment any code.

## Lab Ten

For this lab, I have added all the functionalities, but I haven't really worked on it's styling so it's quite plain. It is however responsive.

Also, I have used react instead of vanilla html, css, and js. I used react to practice it while also completing the lab. And just to clarify, I did use Chat GPT to help me create the structure of my react application and also to help me understand thins since after going through some youtube videos, I still couln't make sense out of react so chat gpt did prove to be quite helpful in this case.

Commands to run - take my instructions with a grain of salt since I'm not familiar with react and they might not work:

- npm install (To install all the dependencies) since I haven't creaeted the production build so to run the website you have to run it in the development way.
- npm start (to start the react application and see the results)
